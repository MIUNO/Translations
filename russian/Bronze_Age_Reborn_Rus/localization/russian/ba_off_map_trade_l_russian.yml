We receive word from our explorers searching for lapis - the strangeness of the unfamiliar climates in the countries they are in has caused spoilage in the food supplies, and now our men are left with hardly anything to eat.\n\nThere are polite requests for a supplementary allowance to buy more provisions."
lapis_trade.14.a: "We will replace the food."
lapis_trade.14.b: "Start rationing the food"

lapis_trade.15.t: "Treason!"
lapis_trade.15.desc: "Something terrible has happened - we hesitate to tell you, but know that concealing such a thing will be worse.\n\nA goodly portion of the men sent to the fight the bandits have actually joined up with them.

lapis_trade.16.t: "Treasure in the East"
lapis_trade.16.desc: "Our men have discovered a treasure in the east! The story is a curious one; our men, having marched for ten hours in the heat of the day, eventually found a stream that led down into a small valley. It was there, on the banks of the waters, that a large settlement was found, and yet it was abandoned completely - no sign of man or animal, no ashes in the hearths.\n\nSearching every home, our men eventually discovered what you now see before you, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]."

Our soldiers showed no mercy and slew their leader as well - we won't have to worry about these highwaymen ever again."
lapis_trade.19.desc_2: "Even though they are undoubtedly a violent bunch, the highwaymen destroying our lapis trade cannot be accused of being stupid. Once we approached them with enough money to make it worth their while to find new pastimes, they were happy to oblige - it appears that they did not want to face the men of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in battle."
lapis_trade.19.desc_3: "We have lost everything! All the men and money, supplies - everything - has been destroyed or taken. The bandits had far greater numbers than reported - some survivors claim there were at least ten thousand, which sounds impossible.

tin_trade.49.t: "A Vulnerable Tin Merchant" #you could extort a merchant ; 50 is a follow-up event about consequences
tin_trade.49.desc: "It is a curious case that we present to you today, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]; there are stories of a tin trader circulating that you need to hear about.\n\nThis merchant, an elderly man who has a touch of senility, traffics in tin and often visits our trade posts. He travels alone, which is rare for someone that carries such valuable goods, and the quality of his stone is unmatched. This merchant refuses to answer where he finds this tin, however, claiming that it is a secret and that he does not want anyone traveling with him - he is unafraid of bandits, he says.\n\nIt would be a trivial thing for us to charge him a 'protection fee' - we could force him to hire some of our men as guards. We wouldn't want anything unseemly to happen to him while traveling through [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], after all, but he will undoubtedly be angered by our heavy hand in his affairs." # extorted_trade_post is a prov scope
tin_trade.49.a: "Fleece him." # extortion
tin_trade.49.b: "We are above that." #do not extort

tin_trade.50.t: "A Wandering Master Artisan"
tin_trade.50.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], I must inform you that [SCOPE.sChar('master_lapis_artisan')GetName], the Master Tin Smith, has told everyone willing to listen of how the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] treated him, and our reputation abroad now reflects this."
tin_trade.50.a: "Who could have thought that?" #bad consequences
tin_trade.50.b: "Well obviously nothing happened..." #nothing happened
tin_trade.50.c: "A good deed does get rewarded!" #good consequences (did not extort)

tin_trade.51.t: "A Titillating Offer" #Tintillating xD
tin_trade.51.desc: "Curiously, we have received messengers from the people of an island far away that call themselves the #E Shekelesh#!. They have proposed that we work together; we can combine our resources with their navigational know-how and perhaps create a trade hub in one of our tin-producing provinces.\n\nAs always, the final authority lies with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]." # new_tin_prov in Libya/Kyrenaika can become a new tin trade hub; Sardinians (who sell tin) offered a deal.
tin_trade.51.a: "This would be very welcome" 
tin_trade.51.b: "We sadly cannot afford this." 

tin_trade.52.t: "A Flourishing Trade Centre"
tin_trade.52.desc: "Everyone has heard of the growing trade routes that pass through [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]; goods from distant lands are loaded onto ships, destined to make the arduous journey over sea before being loaded into caravans in unfamiliar ports.\n\nThere is word that one of our trade ports has grown into something larger; enough people have moved into the settlement that it can be called a proper city." # flourishing_trade_post becomes a city for free
tin_trade.52.a: "Let us do what we can to help grow this project of ours" #pls change lol; pay some casha nd get some buildings way cheaper than usual
tin_trade.52.b: "Let nature run its course" #nothing happens extra

tin_trade.53.t: "Tin Trade Attracts People"
tin_trade.53.desc: "Stories of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s fabled wealth have spread far and wide, with many abandoning their homes and villages to seek their fortunes in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] or its environs. The reason for this sudden influx is self-evident; the explosive growth in the tin trade has attracted these newcomers.\n\nThere is growing pressure on us to ensure that we are taking care of the people, but this is an expensive endeavor." # 
tin_trade.53.a: "Make sure there's enough space for everyone." 
tin_trade.53.b: "... and build some basic infrastructure." 
tin_trade.53.c: "We do not care for our subject's behaviour."

tin_trade.73.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is training one morning with the bow when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] soldiers burst into the courtyard, dragging behind them a wounded man named [SCOPE.sChar('expedition_lead')GetName]. Although it has been forbidden, it seems that [SCOPE.sChar('expedition_lead')GetFirstName] has been attempting to find tin deposits of his own accord.\n\nWhy, then, is he in such bad shape? What happened to his expedition? There is a lot of explaining that [SCOPE.sChar('expedition_lead')GetFirstName] has to do." #expedition_lead is the wounded guy
tin_trade.73.a: "Pry all his secrets out of him." # question him - he'll be of another realm, the only survivor of an expedition in search of a new rumored tin deposit. His company starved and fell prey to beasts.

tin_trade.74.desc: "After questioning the soles of [SCOPE.sChar('expedition_lead')GetName]'s feet, it appears that everything [SCOPE.sChar('expedition_lead')GetSheHe] has offered is true; there is a tin deposit that is only a few day's ride from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Although there are bandits in the mountains, we shouldn't let them scare us away from the motherlode!"

tin_trade.76.a: "Good for them..."
