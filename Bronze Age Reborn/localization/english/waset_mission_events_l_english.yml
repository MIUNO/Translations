 me_waset_upper_egypt.1.t:0 "Burning of Nekhen"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.1.desc:2 "After serving as capital of Upper Egypt since time immemorial, the city of the hawk has met a most ignoble end at the hands of our troops. They have systematically seized anything of value that wasn't bolted down, and set the rest to fire. Not even the cult temple of the local deity, Horus, was spared the flames. \n\nThe river has carried its ashes downstream even as far as Waset - what we hope should now be the sole great power in the south."
 me_waset_upper_egypt.1.a:0 "They should have submitted when they still could"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.2.t:0 "The Priesthood of Horus"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.2.desc:2 "Nekhen, the spiritual capital of Upper Egypt, is finally within our grasp. Our conquest of the city has given us an excellent opportunity to patronize the local priesthood of Horus, if we wish to do so.\n\nWhile it will take a reasonable sum of gold, doing so is likely to improve our legitimacy."
 me_waset_upper_egypt.2.a:0 "Of course!"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.2.b:0 "Montu is better, anyway"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.5.t:0 "Burning of Nekhen"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.5.desc:2 "Ill news from the troubled south. Though reports are confused, it seems that the great city of Nekhen is no more.\n\nApparently, troops from the hithero minor provincial town of Waset have managed to take the city and, in a fit of unprecedented brutality, plundered it's riches and set everything that could burn on fire. Not even the splendid temple of the local deity, Horus, has managed to escape destruction."
 me_waset_upper_egypt.5.a:0 "Vicious savages!"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.10.t:0 "An Envoy from the North"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.10.desc:2 "An emissary has arrived from the city of Waset, demanding our submission and recognition of their rightful authority. Though our initial reaction was to balk at such a proposal, the rumours of the fate of Nekhen has left some nervous that we ourselves might suffer such a fate should the soldiers of Waset come to our doorstep..."
 me_waset_upper_egypt.10.a:0 "Better be on the safe side"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.10.b:0 "We will never bow!"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.11.t:0 "Emissary Returns"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.11.desc:2 "Our emissary has returned from Abu, bearing good news. It seems that the local heritep has seen reason and swore fealty to us.\n\nThis is a great victory for us - not only is our rear now secure, but we've managed to do so without shedding any blood."
 me_waset_upper_egypt.11.a:0 "A wise choice!"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.12.t:0 "Emissary Returns"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.12.desc:2 "Our emissary has returned from Abu, bearing ill tidings. It seems that the local heritep has let their pride come before reason, and has rebuked our overtures.\n\nUnfortunately, this leaves us with no choice but to secure the strategically important fortress through force."
 me_waset_upper_egypt.12.a:0 "That impertinent scoundrel...!"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.20.t:0 "An Envoy from the South"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.20.desc:0 "An emissary has arrived from the city of Waset, demanding our submission and recognition of their rightful authority. Though we have managed to preserve our sovereignity up until now, as powerful polities begin to coalesce throughout the Nile valley, this is likely to become increasingly difficult.\n\nRather than swearing fealty for Waset, however, some in our court have instead suggested aligning ourselves with the northern dynasty based in Henen-Nesut. Alternatively, we could simply stay neutral, and hope that the two will be too distracted fighting each other to focus on us."
 me_waset_upper_egypt.20.a:0 "Accept the proposal"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.20.b:0 "Follow the north, instead"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.20.c:0 "We'll stay out of this"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.21.t:0 "Emissary Returns"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.21.desc:2 "Our emissary has returned from one of the heriutep, bearing good news. It seems that they have seen reason and swore fealty to us."
 me_waset_upper_egypt.21.a:0 "A wise choice!" 
 me_waset_upper_egypt.22.t:0 "Emissary Returns"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.22.desc:2 "Our emissary has returned from one of the heriutep, bearing ill tidings. It seems that they have let their pride come before reason, and have rebuked our overtures.\n\nWorse yet, they seem to have outright declared their support for the House of Khety!"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.22.a:0 "We'll have the last laugh!"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.23.t:0 "Emissary Returns"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.23.desc:2 "Our emissary has returned from one of the heriutep, bearing ill tidings. It seems that they have let their pride come before reason, and have rebuked our overtures.\n\nThankfully, though, they have not declared for the House of Khety either, so at least they won't be an immediate enemy."
 me_waset_upper_egypt.23.a:0 "It could have been worse"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.24.t:0 "Emissary Arrives"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.24.desc:2 "An emissary from one of the heriutep of Middle Egypt has arrived, informing us that they will be rallying to our cause again Waset!\n\nThough they have received an envoy from our southern rival as well, they claim to have rejected their demands in the harshest possible terms, and have professed their undying loyalty to us."
 me_waset_upper_egypt.24.a:0 "Excellent!"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.25.t:0 "The Gathering Storm"
 me_waset_upper_egypt.25.desc:2 "It seems that the power vacuum in Upper Egypt has finally allowed one of the local heriutep to prevail over the other rulers of the region, and they are now greedily eyeing our rightful domains in Middle Egypt. \n\nThese petty upstarts apparently hail from the provincial backwater of Waset, and now their domain stretches from Nekhen to Abdju. Unfortunately, some of our southern heriutep seem to have lapsed and are ready to throw in their lot with this rising power. Conflict is inevitable, and this is likely to prove to be a period when the strength of our rule, and the loyalty of our subjects, is going to be tested more than ever before."
 me_waset_upper_egypt.25.a:0 "We shall prevail"
