However, our Minoan neighbors to the south are beginning to consolidate; if left unchecked, they will soon be in a position to take our place, and we will become nothing more then a distant memory. By unifying the Cyclades under a single banner, we might yet avoid this fate and ensure our supremacy for generations to come."
