 waset_1_upper_egypt:0 "Unite Upper Egypt"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_DESCRIPTION:0 "As the old pharaonic seat of Men-Nefer continues to slide into impotent irrelevancy, nowhere is the retreat of royal power more acutely felt than in our region. As Upper Egypt degenerates into into anarchy, it falls on none other than us to restore divine order."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when all of Egypt from #Y Abu#! down to #Y Zawty#! has been conquered."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_REWARD_DESCRIPTION:0 "Upper Egypt"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:1 "We shall unite Upper Egypt under our wise rule, and crush any foolish enough to stand in our way."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_BUTTON_DETAILS:0 ""
 waset_1_upper_egypt_local_nomarchs:0 "Crush the Heriutep"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_local_nomarchs_DESC:0 "The local heriutep seem to have forgotten their former place, their ambitions outgrowing their nominally subservient posts. It is time we remind these petty warlords of their obligations, and show them to whom exactly those obligations are now owed."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_local_nomarchs_1:0 "#Y Netjerui Sepat#! is dominated by us"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_local_nomarchs_2:0 "#Y Meseh Sepat#! is dominated by us"

 waset_1_upper_egypt_nekhen:0 "Confront Nekhen"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_nekhen_DESC:0 "The city of Nekhen to our south has enjoyed the privilege of being one of Upper Egypt's foremost cities since time immemorial. It is no surprise that the local heritep there has delusions of grandeur, and pretensions to a throne that should rightfully be ours. If we are to ever be secure in our southern hegemony, we will need to take the city."

 waset_1_upper_egypt_raze_nekhen:0 "Horus' Woe"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_raze_nekhen_DESC:0 "With Nekhen finally within our grasp, we will make sure that it never rises to challenge us again. Out of the ashes of the city, hopefully Waset will grow into the new southern spiritual seat of power - and if not, at least we will have one less rival to worry about."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_raze_nekhen_tooltip:0 "The city of #Y Nekhen#! will be burned to the ground and it's inhabitants scattered throughout the country\n#Y Waset#! will grow in importance"

 waset_1_upper_egypt_tolerate_nekhen_DESC:0 "Our most significant rival in the region has fallen to our troops, opening a unique political opportunity to bolster our legitimacy."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_tolerate_nekhen_tooltip:0 "We will have the option of patronizing the local cult of Horus in #Y Nekhen#!"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_abu:0 "Secure the South"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_abu_DESC:0 "With Nekhen fallen, the only real threat to our rear is the island-fortress of Abu. If we were to bring it into the fold, we could be able to exclusively focus on conquering downstream."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_abu_1_tooltip:0 "#Y Nubt Sepat#! is dominated by us"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_abu_2_tooltip:0 "#Y Ta-Seti Sepat#! is dominated by us"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_threaten_abu:0 "Cow the South"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_threaten_abu_DESC:0 "Nekhen's grisly fate has made some reconsider whether continued independence is worth the risk - none more than the now isolated island fortress of Abu to our south. With some luck, we might be able to convince them to swear fealty in exchange for mercy."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_wadi_hammamat:0 "Quarry the Valley of Baths"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_wadi_hammamat_DESC:0 "The great mines and quarries of the Valley of Baths have been all but abandoned since Egypt descended into anarchy. Reestablishing control could prove to be a massive economic boon."

 waset_1_upper_egypt_abdju:0 "City of the Dead"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_abdju_DESC:0 "Abdju, the major cult center and favored burial ground of the kings of old, has stubbornly refused to renounce it's allegiance to the House of Khety. If they will not accept the carrot we are offering, we will have to resort to the stick instead."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_abdju_1_tooltip:0 "#Y Ta-Wer Sepat#! is dominated by us"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_abu_fort:0 "Bulwark of the Nile"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_abu_fort_DESC:0 "Kushite raiders have used the ongoing chaos to their advantage, launching incursions deep into the Ta-Seti Sepat. We should fortify the island of Abu and make them think twice before encroaching onto our lands."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_abu_trade:0 "Kushite Trade"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_abu_trade_DESC:0 "The island of Abu provides a convenient point where trade from Kush can be regulated and taxed. We should make the most of this opportunity."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_middle_egypt:0 "The Fight for Middle Egypt"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_middle_egypt_DESC:0 "As we further expand downstream, we begin reaching areas where the influence of the rival House of Khety begins to be acutely felt. The heriutep of Middle Egypt have so far avoided taking one side or the other, but it is time to force their hand. The true battle for Kemet is about to begin."
 waset_1_upper_egypt_middle_egypt_tooltip:0 "We will send emissaries to the heriutep of Middle Egypt, demanding allegiance\nThose that refuse are likely to declare for #Y Henen-Nesut#! instead, #R so make sure to try and improve your relations with the heriutep first#!"
 waset_1_upper_egypt_middle_egypt_condition:0 "There must be at least two unaligned heriutep in Middle Egypt, otherwise the task will be bypassed"
