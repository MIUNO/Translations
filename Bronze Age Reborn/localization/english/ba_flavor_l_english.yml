 pagasai_port_desc:0 "The Pagasaean Gulf has been limited to a quiet place of safety for local ships for too long. The people say it, and the oracle of Apollon wills it. It is time that we build a great harbour and send out ships to see and conquer the waiting lands beyond our cozy harbour. /n Utilizing the strong and abundant wood from nearby Mt. Pelion, you will build a port to rival all others; one which will launch the greatest heroes out into the world. This new curb of civilization will bring forth a fleet of sturdy ships to carry out countless explorers and well-greaved armies and return with riches untold. Apollon guides you."

# Events

ba_flavour_events.3.t:0 "Gold Mine Yields"
ba_flavour_events.3.desc:0 "The gold found in [GetProvince('int32(2149)')GetName] has started to yield a hefty income. It was a wise investment. Hopefully, it will remain that way for a long time."
ba_flavour_events.3.a:0 "I am smart!"

ba_flavour_events.4.t:0 "Gigantic Bones"
ba_flavour_events.4.desc:0 "My lord, some hunters have found a gigantic bone in a cave, and it seems that there are more. They come in different shapes and sizes, clearly more than just an arm or a leg. The hunters believe that it is the last resting place of a dead god. What should we do?"
ba_flavour_events.4.a:0 "Look through the cave."
ba_flavour_events.4.b:0 "Let the dead rest in peace."

ba_flavour_events.5.t:0 "Gigantic Bones"
ba_flavour_events.5.desc:0 "My lord, some hunters have found some big bones sticking out of the mud after the rain, and it seems that there are more. They come in different shapes and sizes, clearly more than just an arm or a leg. The hunters believe to have found a battlefield of the gods or giants. The biggest piece is a giant horn - it must be of dragon or one of his ilk."
ba_flavour_events.5.a:0 "Go through the mud."
ba_flavour_events.5.b:0 "Let the dead rest in peace."

ba_flavour_events.6.t:0 "Bone Shield"
ba_flavour_events.6.desc:0 "While plowing his new fields, a farmer hit a big bone. He has turned to us for help, for it disturbs his seeding plans. He is unsure as to what creature it was. One of his neighbours suggested that it could be a shield of a god."

ba_flavour_events.8.t:0 "The Assyrian Army"
ba_flavour_events.8.desc:0 "Recently, we were defeated by the powerful [SCOPE.sUnit('target')GetOwner.GetAdjective] forces. Multiple times.

ba_flavour_events.8.a:0 "Eventually, we will take them down a peg."
ba_flavour_events.8.b:0 "Our traditional ways suit us fine."

ba_flavour_events.9.t:0 "Divine Poetry"
ba_flavour_events.9.desc:0 "Today a young poet has reached our court, presenting us with four different hymns, each, he says, dictated by a different deity in his dreams. We shall chose our favourite and have it sung across our realm. \nOne is dedicated to war: its battles, its glory and valour, but also reminding us of death and losses. Vigour, life and death; it is the cycle of life. \nAnother one is dedicated to wealth and prosperity, describing the gods farming and trading, their adornments and temples growing in number and size, eliciting envy from onlookers. \nThe third one is all about power and diplomacy; control. How trickery can cause the downfall of one and the rise of another; how a well-said word can triumph over the spear. A caress, a whisper by a lover can lead an entire nation into the abyss of time, forgotten. \n The last hymn is dedicated to knowledge, understanding, philosphy: How can I till a field with less effort? What weapon can I use that my enemy cannot protect against? Why have the gods created us? What is my purpose?"

ba_flavour_events.12.t:0 "The Dance of Sun and Moon" # Calendar // Of Sun and Moon
ba_flavour_events.12.desc:0 "Based on mathematics, Astronomy has started to influence the day-to-day life of our citizen. Some count the days, from sunrise to sunset, from season to season. Others order their lives based on the waxing and waning of the moon; every three, a new season arises. Some structure their existence based on the moon for farming and on the sun for the day, the options are endless. \nThere are some trends that can be discovered: those who follow the sun tend to have others work for them, giving them power yet making them dependent. Those who follow the moon live simpler, freer lives; they live in smaller groups on the land and are rarely seen in the cities."
ba_flavour_events.12.a:0 "We follow the moon."
ba_flavour_events.12.b:0 "We follow the sun."
ba_flavour_events.12.c:0 "We follow both."

ba_flavour_events.13.t:0 "Calendar"
ba_flavour_events.13.desc_1:0 "Over a decade ago, we chose to follow the sun as our guide through day and night, winter and summer, through life in short. Today, we can see what we have achieved thanks to the guidance of the sun: some of our noblemen are capably leading our nation while others invent new tools and weaponry. We have advanced as a nation and culture, leading our people ahead of our neighbours."
ba_flavour_events.13.desc_2:0 "Over a decade ago, we chose to follow both the sunand the moon as our guides through day and night and the seasons. Like a woman's body, the moon lives and dies every month, a harbinger of fertility. The sun rises each day, disciplined like a man. Together we have achieved incredible successes; many babes were born under the guidance of the wise women and many captives well-used for building our homes and the cycle of life continues on."
ba_flavour_events.13.desc_3:0 "Over a decade ago, we chose to follow the moon as our guide through the seasons. Through its waxing and waning, we organise our daily lives. Many are free, unburdened by the whims of a noble or the squalor of a city. While the king guarantees the general safety, he cannot order us around as he wants; he needs us just as we need him."
ba_flavour_events.13.a:0 "In the sun we trust."
ba_flavour_events.13.b:0 "In the name of the sun and the moon."
ba_flavour_events.13.c:0 "The moon bless [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]." 

ba_flavour_events.14.t:0 "A Merchant's Lament" # 
ba_flavour_events.14.desc:0 "Recently, there has been a merchant sending complaint letters about the behaviour of some of our overseers and advisors. First, he describes how some set some arbitrary rules, that hurt him and his business. He then goes on about how they would demand a tithe in order to let him go about his business. He asks of us, his ruler, to prevent any further extortion of him and his fellow merchants."
ba_flavour_events.14.a:0 "He speaks truth."
ba_flavour_events.14.b:0 "Our advisors are wise."

ba_flavour_events.15.t:0 "Of Canaan and Kemet" # 
ba_flavour_events.15.desc:0 "Since we conquered a large part of the Nile Delta, some have questioned our authority there, since are not as present as we should. At the same time, at home, some have started to plot, for we aren't present there either. We have to concentrate our power once more - yet where should we centre our focus?"
ba_flavour_events.15.a:0 "Our old capital of power shall remain the seat of power."
ba_flavour_events.15.b:0 "To secure our vast conquests, we must move closer to them."

ba_flavour_events.16.t:0 "Of Canaan and Kemet" # 
ba_flavour_events.16.desc:0 "With the decision to move our seat of power to the Nile Delta, the people in our old relam feel abandoned and betrayed. We have to do something about that, and some our advisors propose moving all of our people to our new homeland, which would concentrate our power. Others propose the installment of a viceroy, a puppet king. Nominally in charge of their own affairs, the people would surely feel closer to their rulers. \nGreedy as it may sound, retaining all that land could be worth it, despite the growing unrest..."
ba_flavour_events.16.a:0 "We have to keep our ancestral lands."
ba_flavour_events.16.b:0 "Put a governor in charge."
ba_flavour_events.16.c:0 "Our future is in Egypt, we should all live there."

ba_flavour_events.17.t:0 "Abandoned Settlements to the South" # 
ba_flavour_events.17.desc:0 "Since some of our neighbouring tribes conquered the Nile Delta, there have been less and less contact with them outside of it. It seems, as if their lands are ripe for the taking."
ba_flavour_events.17.a:0 "No one will notice a small piece."
ba_flavour_events.17.b:0 "We should take bit more."
ba_flavour_events.17.c:0 "We should grab as much land as we can."

ba_flavour_events.18.t:0 "Kemetic Resistance" # 
ba_flavour_events.18.desc:0 "With our decision of kepping our court in our ancestral lands, we have effectively given up on controlling the natives of the Nile who now make their displeasure known. Rather than serving foreigners who do not know the right way of life, they insist on their leader follorwing their ancestral practices. Some of our advisors see an easy solution to this growing problem: if we were to adhere to their religious practices, we could win over many a heart, for the way is what matters and not the form or the origin. We wouldn't be the first to claim the throne from another, weaker dynasty."
ba_flavour_events.18.a:0 "Placate them by adhering to their traditions.."
ba_flavour_events.18.b:0 "They shall bow!"
